AI: Deep learning model used for house loan data analysis

# Project Background:
• analyzing historical housing loan datasets.
• focusing on my project concentrates on anticipating whether a loan candidate will default on debt repayment. 
• Since loan datasets are remarkably skewed, the project adopts data preprocessing, balancing approaches.
• Using SMOTE to get balance datasets from the target variable.
• Making a deep learning model under TensorFlow and Keras to yield trustworthy predictions.

# Tools and Technologies:
• Jupyter Notebook (Python).
• NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
• Scikit-learn (SMOTE.
• Data preprocessing tools, model evaluation metrics, SMOTE used in scikit-learn.
• TensorFlow ( Keras) in deep learning model.

# Workflow:
• upload the dataset into jupyter notebook.
• Reviewed the dataset structure with null values, and statistics (overview).
• Examined the default / non-default values in the target column.
• Encoded categorical columns before model training.
• Used SMOTE to make datasets in balance.
• Applied TensorFlow and Keras to make and then train a deep learning model.
• Tested model efficacy with recall) and roc-auc.
• Visualized target column and model findings. 

# Objective:
• Do all operations associated with data preprocessing incorporating addressing null values, encoding categorical variables, and equalizing the original dataset with SMOTE.
• Explore and visualize the target (label) distribution to understand data asymmetry.
• Make a deep learning model which is used to forecast whether a financing applicant can pay loan or not using the housing loan historical data.
• Train the model.
• Examine the model with sensitivity.
• Target prediction performance via roc-auc.

# Conclusion:
• Proficiently created an end to end project pipeline to predict loan default under the finance discipline.
• Addressed category imbalance with applying SMOTE 
• Prepared the housing loan dataset with appropriate encoding for model training.
• Secured a reasonable ROC-AUC score with the deep learning model used to classify loan borrowers at high risk and reliable borrowers.
• Emphasized the model’s efficiency using sensitivity results to find emerging defaults, which is crucial for managing loan risk.
• Due to uneven class distribution, accuracy was diminished, but the model delivers a clear framework for future improvements. 
• Further refinement can be accomplished through model parameter adjustment, integrated models with cutting age feature selection approaches.
